# About

I am a creative, determined and enthusiastic full-stack web developer and product manager, with an international background in branding, research and analysis. I left an award-winning agency and enrolled in an intensive three-month web development course at General Assembly to equip myself with the skills needed to pursue my dream of working with emergent technologies that donâ€™t simply react to culture, but disrupt and reshape it. For the past few months I've worked with a small development team at a health communications agency, focusing mainly on front-end design and development and contributing to multiple projects. I may be relatively new to the world of technology, but I am smart and committed, with both the ability and willingness to learn under pressure and on-the-job.
