# About

I am a creative, determined and enthusiastic full-stack web developer, with an international background in branding, research and analysis. I left an award-winning agency and enrolled in an intensive three-month web development course at General Assembly to equip myself with the skills needed to pursue my dream of working with emergent technologies that don’t simply react to culture, but disrupt and reshape it. For the past few months I have worked alongside a small development team for a health communications agency, focusing mainly on front-end design and development and contributing to multiple projects. I may be relatively new to the world of web development, but I am smart and committed, with both the ability and willingness to learn under pressure and on-the-job.
