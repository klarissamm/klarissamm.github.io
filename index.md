# Coming Soon

<!-- I am a creative and determined technology enthusiast with an international background in development, research and analysis. I have worked at an award-winning research agency and completed an intensive three-month web development course at General Assembly. This has equipped me with the skills I need to pursue my goal of working with emergent technologies that donâ€™t simply react to culture, but disrupt and reshape it. -->

<!-- For the past few months I've worked with a small development team at a health communications agency, focusing mainly on front-end design and development and contributing to multiple projects. I am relatively new to the world of technology, but I am smart and committed, with both the ability and willingness to learn under pressure and on-the-job. -->
